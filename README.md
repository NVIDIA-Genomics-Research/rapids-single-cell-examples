# GPU-Accelerated Single-Cell Genomics Analysis with RAPIDS

This repository contains example notebooks demonstrating how to use [RAPIDS](https://www.rapids.ai) for GPU-accelerated analysis of single-cell sequencing data.

## Installation 

All dependencies for this example can be installed with conda. CUDA versions 10.1 and 10.2 are supported currently. If installing for a system running a CUDA10.1 driver, use `conda/rapidgenomics_cuda10.1.yml`

```bash
conda env create --name rapidgenomics -f conda/rapidgenomics_cuda10.2.yml
conda activate rapidgenomics
python -m ipykernel install --user --display-name "Python (rapidgenomics)"
```

After installing the necessary dependencies, you can just run `jupyter lab`.

## Human Lung Cell Atlas Example

We present an example using RAPIDS to accelerate the analysis of a ~70,000-cell single-cell RNA sequencing dataset from human lung cells. This example includes preprocessing, dimension reduction, clustering visualization and gene ranking. 

### Example Dataset

The dataset is based on [Travaglini et al. 2020](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/742320v2). If you wish to run the notebook using the same data, use the following command to download the count matrix for this dataset and store it in the `data` folder:

```bash
wget -P <path to this repository>/data https://rapids-single-cell-examples.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/krasnow_hlca_10x_UMIs.sparse.h5ad
```

### Example Code

Follow this [Jupyter notebook](notebooks/hlca_lung_gpu_analysis.ipynb) for RAPIDS analysis of this dataset. Please note that in order for the commands in the notebook to run, the file [rapids_scanpy_funcs.py](notebooks/rapids_scanpy_funcs.py) needs to be in the same folder as the notebook.

We provide a second notebook with the CPU version of this analysis [here](notebooks/hlca_lung_cpu_analysis.ipynb).

### Adapting to another dataset

For our examples, we stored the count matrix in a sparse `.h5ad` format. To convert a different count matrix into this format, follow the instructions in [this notebook](notebooks/csv_to_h5ad.ipynb).

### Acceleration

All runtimes are given in seconds.
